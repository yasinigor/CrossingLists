We have two lists with the same objects:
list1<Element> and list2<Element>, where Element is :
class Element {
String name;
}

The lists may contain objects that may overlap.
Array elements are not unique
The task of the project is to print a list of unique objects
and show in which arrays they were located
For example:
Element1 - Liist1
Element2 - Liist1, Liist2
Element3 - Liist2
